<h1> How To Choose and Design a Custom Bike </h1>

<p>The first thing you want to do is decide what type of bike best suits your needs,
   there are two main catgories of Bicycle road, and mountain. Each of these have differen subcategories. Choosing the correct bike can reduce
   wear and tear on the bike and therefore the longlivity of the bike.</p>
<h1>Types of Road Bikes</h1>
<a href ="#Types of Mountain Bikes">Types of Mountain Bikes</a>
<h2>Performance Road Bikes</h2>


<p>  First up, the performance road bikes, these bikes are generally very sleek and made to be as light as possible.
These fellas are made to go fast and get that one up on your opponent.
The performance road bike frames can be made from the usual bike materials: aluminium, and steel,
each giving a different feel for the rider. Whilst the upper echelons of high-end performance bikes will be made from carbon fibre,
which reduces the weight of the bike considerably. Stiff frames are common, giving responsive handling that will give you the edge on other riders.
Cutting through the air is the name of the game and the position of the rider is an important aspect.
With these bikes, the lower front end puts the rider in an aerodynamic position, allowing a faster, smoother ride.

<h2>Sportive Bikes</h2>
<p>
If you want a more relaxed version of a road racer, we have the sportive road bikes.
Designed for long distance riding,
they accommodate slightly wider tyres, which give far more grip and comfort.
Sportive bike frames have been built with more vertical compliance,
allowing for a more comfortable ride over extreme terrain such as the world famous Paris-Roubaix.
Slightly heavier than a road racer, this bike has it where it counts,
with lower gearing helping the rider get up those big hills.

<h2>Cyclocross Bikes</h2>
<p>
Cyclo-cross or Gravel bikes are the tougher, muddier cousin of the road racer. Cyclo-cross is mostly a winter discipline,
with riders having to tackle an off-road course, getting extremely muddy and a touch of hurdles.
Due to the obstacles on the course, dismounting and carrying their bike over with a
quick remount is a common feature of the winter races. With this in mind, the more frequent frame
materials are aluminium and carbon, offering a lightweight bike to pick up whilst leaping over a
stray fallen log. Cyclo-cross bikes that are used for the race circuits tend to be slightly higher
off the ground than road racers, giving them great mud clearance.

<h2>Touring Bikes</h2>
<p>
 The Bear Grylls of the road bikes, the Touring bike is made for the great outdoor adventure. Pack up everything
 (including the kitchen sink) and leave your daily commute behind. Touring frames are built to last,
 with wider gaps between tubes allowing for maximum luggage space.
 With rear racks, mudguards and all sorts of saddlebags, the tyres of a Touring bike are designed
 to carry all that weight and more! The frame material for touring bikes,
 generally are made of steel which is easily repairable no matter where you are in the world!
 Disc brakes are becoming more common, which gives you a fair bit of control in all sorts of
 weather you will be encountering.

<h2>TT – Time Trial/Triathlon</h2>
<p>
If you want a bike that is faster than a Lamborghini and is pushing on the speed of light,
then you’ll probably have to keep looking.
If you’re looking for a bike built to go as fast as possible with the most aerodynamic design,
then a TT bike is for you! The majority of these bad boys are made from carbon,
leaving no space for anything to weigh them down. All brake and gear cables are routed through
the tubes themselves, taking away anything that is going to slow it down.
The rider sits low and extended over the bike, with aero bars extending out the front
for cutting through the wind. Rounding off the set up is carbon fibre rims,
slicing through the air with very little resistance and using up less energy.

<h2>Hybrid Bikes</h2>


<p>
Not technically a road bike and not technically a mountain bike either.
Hybrid bikes are the Frankenstein monster of cycling world, taking the best bits from
the road (the large/light frames and the 700c wheels) and mountain (the flat
handlebars and the disc brakes) disciplines and combining them into a smooth, fast commuter’s
dream. The frames, mostly made from aluminium, allow a good combination of strength and the
advantage of being lightweight (useful for carrying all your work essentials).
These are no nonsense bikes; not something you’ll be using in the Tour De France with, but
getting you to and from work. The rider sits more upright on a hybrid, with comfort and more
importantly safety within traffic in mind.

<h1>Types of Mountain Bikes</h1>

<p>
There are three main mountain bie frames to be aware of when choosing a mountain bike
ridged frames, hardtails and full suspenaion.</p>
<p>
Rigid: These mountain bikes have no suspension on the front fork or rear. Not much to say here
other than if you are beginner and this is your choice
for off-pavement / hard-pack dirt you’ll just get beat to a pulp and hate mountain biking before
you get a chance to like it. These are comfortable versatile bikes for riding on pavement that are
safer and more user-friendly than road bikes.</p>

<p>
Hardtail: a mountain bike with suspension shocks on the front fork, but not the rear.
These are more affordable, which for your budget, will allow you to purchase a bike with better
components that are lighter. Hardtail bikes also have better handling than entry-level full-suspension
bikes. Hardtail mountain bikes are not just for entry-level riders looking to save some money:
their lighter weight and rigidity make them excellent cross country bikes and racing bikes.

<p>Full-suspension: Full-suspension bikes have suspension in the front and rear, which improves
comfort and helps you ride more technical terrain. They are generally more expensive and weigh more.
Most beginner mountain bikers wait until they're more experienced to buy their first full-suspension bike.

<h2>Downhill</h2>
<p>
Otherwise called Park bikes these bikes are full-suspension and are heavy, with maximum suspension in the front
(200 mm+) and rear of your not-good-for-riding-uphill bike. I refer to them as motocross bikes without
the motor. Tires are big and very knobby.</p>

<h2>All-mountain / Enduro</h2>
<p>
The term enduro comes from the moto racing world and describes a competition where
downhill sections are timed and uphill sections are not. All-mountain/enduro mountain bikes are
more functional going uphill than downhill-specific bikes but are less versatile
than XC or Trail bikes. Generally, they have more travel in the front suspension (around 150 mm)
and are beefier than XC or Trail bikes with wider tires.
</p>

<h2>Trail</h2>

<p>
These bikes are the most popular mountain bikes, with decreased weight, mid-range front fork
travel (120-150 mm) and bike geometry that favors comfort over pure performance.
</p>
<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0449/8573/files/trail-mountain-bike_grande.jpg?7506848688689628353"/>
<h2> Cross-country (XC)</h2>
<p>
These mountain bikes are all about climbing and speed for longer, epic rides in the backcountry.
The most important variable in XC bikes is low weight and efficient / smooth shifting.
The bike’s ability to deal with technical terrain sections takes a backseat to rolling efficiency
and pedaling. Very light, very expensive full-suspension bikes are used here or commonly used hardtail mountain bikes.

<h2> Fat bikes</h2>
<p>
These bikes are designed for riding on snow and sand, or anywhere you need ridiculously big tires
(as wide as 5 inches) for maximum grip. Fat bikes are all about 4-seasons cycling versatility.
